# Had some issues with 1999, failing tie-break check because:
#   1. We had a tie between Dale/Vaughn with equivalent tie break scores.
#   2. The Game 10 submit times were later than the deadline (loaded from Excel).
#   3. I modified each player's submit time to be earlier than deadline.
#   4. I randomly set Dale earlier than Vaughn.
#   5. Had to set the Week winner to Dale.
